### A portfolio website of mine.

---

This website includes so many animations and designs that makes this website way better.  
But in recent days, we noticed that the svg icons taking too much times to load from font-awesome server.  

So, you may see some loading or performance issues while visiting this site.

> I'm looking for a solution to prevent this problem. Or maybe I have done that while you're reading this.
